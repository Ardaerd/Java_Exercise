<h1>SwapPairs</h1>

<p>Write a method swapPairs that switches the order of values in an ArrayList of Strings in
a pairwise fashion. Your method should switch the order of the first two values, then switch the order
of the next two, switch the order of the next two, and so on. For example, if the list initially stores these values:
    {"to", "be", "or", "not", "to", "be", "hamlet"} It would again switch pairs of values, but the final value, "hamlet" would not be moved,
    yielding this list: {"be", "to", "not", "or", "be", "to", "hamlet"}</p>
