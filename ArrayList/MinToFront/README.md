<h2>MinToFront</h2>
<p>Write a method minToFront that takes an ArrayList of integers as a parameter and that moves the minimum value in the list to the front, otherwise preserving the order of the elements. For example, if a variable called list stores the following values: {3, 8, 92, 4, 2, 17, 9} and you make this call: minToFront(list); it should store the following values after the call: {2, 3, 8, 92, 4, 17, 9} You may assume that the list stores at least one value.</p>
