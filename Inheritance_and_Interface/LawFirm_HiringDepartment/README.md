<h2>Law Firm Hiring Department</h2>
<p>Imagine a large law firm that hires several classes of employees: lawyers, general secretaries, legal secretaries, and marketers. The company has a number of employee rules about vacation and sick days, medical benefits, harassment regulations, and so on. Each subdivision of the company also has a few of its own rules; for example, lawyers may use a different form to ask for vacation leave than do secretaries.</p>
